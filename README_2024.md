# Diachronic Language Models 

This seminar is held by Wei Zhao, Yi Fan

## Overview

Despite huge progress in Large Language Models (LLMs), which have revolutionized the way we consume text-based information through conversational interface, their ability to understand knowledge and language at different points in time from the past to present remains unclear. This capability may seem nascent at first glance, but it has the potential to impact people’s lives at the greatest. For instance, approximately 30% of search engine queries worldwide (over 2 billion Google queries every day) are time-sensitive, making it crucial for LLMs to ensure the temporal relevance of model responses. Additionally, this capability is essential for the automatic induction of previously non-existent low-resource and bilingual dictionaries that reflect language change over time; LLMs, when temporally grounded, would provide a means of dictionary induction to support the EU’s multilingualism policy and globalization efforts beyond the EU. In this course, we will explore the following topics:
- Evaluating the temporal grounding of LLMs
- Demystifying model delusionality and rationality over time
- Manipulating LLMs to force model responses to be time-relevant
- Applications of LLMs in automatic dictionary induction

This course extends upon the first edition of Diachronic Language Models in WS23/24 which previously covered diachronic modeling and analyses of language change over time. Having attended last year’s course edition is helpful but not necessary.

This seminar course takes place at Heidelberg University on Tuesdays from 15:15 to 16:45, in INF 329 / SR 26.

## Organization

For the second edition, our aim shifts to group projects on the same subject with a focus on temporal LLMs. The group project tasks include literature reading, idea implementation, experimentation, results analysis and writing a final term paper. 3-5 students work in a group on a novel topic and write a joint paper of 8-10 pages. There will be weekly exchanges with the supervisor, as well as mid-term and final presentation meetings.
