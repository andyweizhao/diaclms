# Diachronic Language Models 

## Overview

The rise of large language models such as ChatGPT marks a moment that seems to blur the boundary between artificial and human intelligence. Such language models excel at comprehending human language, and provide assistance to individuals in many text works. In this seminar, we will delve into the domain of large language models, with a particular focus given to diachronic models. These models require the ability to understand the development of human language, including both the past and the present, as well as the changes that occur over time. To begin, we will look into the development of human language, namely language change and variation over time. We will then explore the machine learning techniques behind diachronic language models. Lastly, we will examine the implications of these models in the fields of historical linguistics, natural language generation and social sciences.

This seminar series takes place at Heidelberg University on Tuesdays from 15:15 to 16:45, in INF 325 / SR 24 during the winter seminster of 2023.

## Language
The seminar will be held in English.

## Best Term Papers
We will select the top-three term papers at the end of the course.
